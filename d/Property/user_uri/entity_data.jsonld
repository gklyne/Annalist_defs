Different URI forms may be used for authentication details obtained by other means.\r\n\r\nThe user URI is used in conjunction with the user id to select a permissions record to be applied.\r\n\r\nThere are two special user URIs that have special meaning in Annalist; see [annal:User](/annalist/c/Annalist_defs/d/Class/User/) for more details:\r\n\r\n* `annal:User/_default_user_perms`\r\n* `annal:User/_unknown_user_perms`\r\n",
